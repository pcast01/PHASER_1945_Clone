# Phaser HTML/JS - 1945 Clone
I ran across this article on Reddit and have been wanting to get more into Javascript so I did it and also added an extra enemy destroyer and Bombs.

To play the game go to [1945 Clone](https://pcast01.github.io/PHASER_1945_Clone/)

*Below are the links for the tutorial*

**Note for older versions of the book (pre-October 2014):**

You should use an older version of this template if you're using an older version of the book (i.e. one that does not specify the Phaser version in the Introduction).

Get the older version via:

    $ git clone https://github.com/bryanbibat/html5shmup-template.git
    $ git checkout 2.0-final
